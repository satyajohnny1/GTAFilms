How not to let your vehicles explode:
-------------------------------------
Submitted by: Muhammad Aizzat b. Rohimi

When you see you vehicles (cars,motorcycles and etc) pause the game 
and type aspirine.It may look wrecked but it wont explode.


Mission: Keep your friends close:
---------------------------------
Submitted by: Kala

As soon as you get control of your character stay in your office and protect 
the safe with a colt python (handgun that kills people in one shot) then when 
it tells you to kill lance just sprint up to him and chase while ignoring 
everyone else. continue chasing lance up the stairs and kill everyone in your 
way(Just before you go on the roof you may want to use cheats like restore 
health and restore armor). When you get to the roof run towards the helicopter 
pad and pick off everyone slowly while hiding behind the wall near the 
helicopter pad. When you kill lance run back down the stairs and get the large 
wide stairs in the huge hall. Then a cutscene with sonny forelli will appear 
and as soon as that is over run away from him and run back upto the rooftop 
where you killed lance, then get out your rocket launcher (use cheat if necessary, 
and remember to refresh your health and armor). With your rocket launcher stand 
on the edge of the rooftop on the tiles until you can see the !
three limosines that spawn enemies then blow those three up to make life easier. 
Then jump all the way down to driveway but make sure you re well away from the 
front stairs when you make your jump. When you hit the ground remember to kill 
anyone attacking you (refresh your health and armor with cheats if necessary). 
Then approach the from the large stairs( you should be outside now). Then fire 
at Sonny like there's now tommorrow with rockets it took me five rockets for 
me to kill him.


Hints:

Submitted by: zishan akhtar
1].
If you want to fight ruthlessly against the police, then go to the
dock areas and get on to the first ship and try shooting the police and the
pedestrians from there. The police wont be able to shoot you from there.

2].
You can start a race in this game too. for this, you have to purchase
sunshine motors in the dockareas. The racing missions will be in the
backward garages.

EASY MONEY? PLAY DIRTY!
-----------------------
Submitted by: Harvey
Its not really a cheat,but its a trick. you can get 40grand per round with this. 
first you at least have 40 grands to buy the showroom near the airport, go to 
the basement, in the right room there is a map of vice city and a list of 
illegal street race. put your bet on 40k winning race. get a vehicle, any 
vehicle, even if you only find a golf cart, use it. go out the show room and 
3 rival cars already park waiting for you. dont park near them yet. go around 
them from the grass field, keep straight until you reach the cross road. go 
to the marina hotel near by, in the middle of the hotel there are bazzoka 
launcher ready to be picked. you know what to do next. go back to the cross 
road, out from your vehicle, take a few steps, watch for cops, aim, and FIRE! 2 
Bazzoka will be enough for your rivals BBQ. get to your vehicle and enjoy a very 
peacefull joyride over the Vice city and win the 40K! in the end of the trips.
 

Keep Your Friends Close (how to beat it without cheating):
----------------------------------------------------------
Although using cheats, it's relatively easy to beat any mission, it's 
a fun challenge to go through the game without cheating (or at least 
not saving when you do)
For the final mission, the best gun to use (in my opinion) is the 
Minigun, which you can buy from Phil's place for the giveaway price 
of $10,000 (but by this point you should have enough money for this 
to be no problem). Also buy extra ammo...
When the mission starts, stand at the top of the stais and shoot 
people before they even get in the front door... you shouldn't even 
get shot once. When Lance comes in, you might have to move back into 
the office, because more men will come from the sides. With the minigun, 
you dont need to chase Lance at all, just shoot at him (and hit) for like 
a second, and he'll die. Same for when Sonny comes in... I beat the 
mission like that only losing about 70 armour. It was easy.


While doing vigilance mission:
-----------------------------
Submitted by:MadMahi(Mahesh)

Type the cheat panzer and get into a tank. After pressing the 
capsLock the mission starts by showing yellow dots the outlaws 
to be eliminated at this point get down from the tank and get 
to a distance from the tank and type big bang the level will be 
completed. Again u can type panzer to get a tank and you can do 
as many level as possibel.


Hints:
------
Submitted by: Varun Pandey

Quick Cash:
-----------
To get some quick cash, go get a gun with auto targeting. I suggest getting a 
Tec9, Uzi, Ingram Mac 10, or MP5 for this part since you can run with those 
weapons. Now that you have it, go to North Point Mall. When you get there, go 
to the Tool Shop. Once there, rob it. Then when you have your wanted level, 
run to The Gash and change costumes. Then, rob The Gash and run to the tool 
shop and change clothes. Now, just repeat the process and the money will rise.


Free Pay N Spray:
-----------------
To do this, just put in the Health cheat before going inside the Pay N Spray 
and it will spray it for free. 


Coppers Can't Get Me Now:
-------------------------
If you are in a Coach, the cops cannot arrest you. They will simply make you 
lose control of the Coach but you will not get arrested. To gain control 
again, just get out of the Coach and get back in. 


Make Decent Money Fast:
-----------------------
This is a really good way to make a quick $1,000. As it turns out, parking is 
ridiculously expensive in Vice City. On a North and South running street in 
Downtown on the second island (south of the Hyman Condo), there is a street 
covered in parking meters (it may be a curved street, I am not sure). If you 
run into them (or maybe use a tool like the hammer or baseball bat), you 
knock about $2-400 out of them. The only problem is if you hit them too fast, 
you will wrap your car around them and they'll get stuck in the engine. 
Explosions are usually imminent. I don't think that this willful destruction 
of private property even generates a wanted level so you're basically just 
able to get decent cash with minimal effort. 


No More Wanted Level:
---------------------
To automatically have no more wanted level, just save your game. Now, load it 
again and no more wanted level. 


Get To Little Havana Early Trick Involving Any Car:
---------------------------------------------------
To do this, just put in the Cars Float On Water cheat and drive there. It's 
as easy as that. 


More Armor:
-----------
If you enter a Enforcer, you will get Body Armor.


More Health:
------------
To get more health, just enter an Ambulance and you will get more. 


More Shotgun Ammo:
------------------
To get a Chrome Shotgun and ammo, just enter a police car. 


Higher Accuracy:
----------------
To higher your accuracy, get a machine gun with lots and lots of ammo. This 
works best when you have infinite ammo from either a cheating device or 
getting 100 percent. You can either get a tank and keep shooting it and it 
will higher your accuracy over time or you can shoot a blown up car carcass. 
If you want to do this without actually having to play, just tape down the 
shoot button and go to sleep. When you wake up, you have a lot better 
accuracy. Try to do this with the M4 and in 3rd person view and not first. 


Look At All The Sea Animals:
----------------------------
I forgot who first made this strategy, but if you go waist high in the water 
along the coasts of the islands, you can crouch down in it and not drown. To 
use this, use your sniper rifle and zoom in and you can see all kinds of 
animals like sharks, turtles, jellyfish, and regular fish. 


Sparrow:
--------
Go to the roof of the building where you first started G Spotlight and there 
will be a Sparrow parked there.There is 
also one on the roof of a house near the Pay N Spray in Ocean Beach. To get 
to it, go to the Collars And Cuffs in Ocean Beach. Then, go down that alley 
where Collars And Cuffs is and there will be a parking garage on your right. 
Go to the top floor and there will be some ramps. Before jumping, look around 
and find the Sparrow and then jump to it. I'm not sure if you can reach it in 
one jump or not so you might half to jump more than 1 roof. The parking 
garage is also located near the Pay N Spray. It is white and has around 5 
stories. For the easiest way, just get to the Pay N Spray in Ocean Beach. 
Now, go to that place right by it with the parked PCJ-600 and Banshee (or 
sometimes Cheetah's or Infernus's). Now, get the PCJ-600 and back up all the 
way from the white stairs. Back up until you have crossed the street and have 
went in the alley with the gray pavement. Keep going back until you reach the 
shrubs. Now, punch the gas and go fast and hit the stairs. You need to clear 
the first building and land on the second one. It is pink. The Sparrow will 
be up there. There is also one across from the Links View Apartment. Across 
the street from it is a building with an arched entrance that you can go in. 
Go inside the arch, there will be some backyards. There should be a Sparrow 
in the first one on your right. 


Guy In Freezer:
---------------
In the opening sequence where Sonny Forelli is talking to all of his men, 
eventually a freezer will be shown in one of the scenes. If you look inside 
it, there is a man being hung by big slabs of meat in the freezer. I guess he 
got on their bad side. 


How to increase your health to 125:
-----------------------------------
Submitted by: MadMahi(Mahesh)

In the night Get a nice car and get near any prostitute (probably 
wearing black dress - 2 piece) and press horn she will come and talk 
to you. Then she will get into the car park the car near any corner 
place. After some times your money will be reducing and your health 
will increase upto 125 get her back to the road. She will get down. 
If you want the money back you can kill her and take it back. 


Constellation Rockstar:
-----------------------
Submitted by:Varun Pandey

At night, there is a constellation of stars that makes up the Rockstar games 
symbol. It is the R with the star/* at the end. 


Someone Give Him A Hand:
------------------------
Submitted by:Varun Pandey

First, go to the butcher shop in Little Havana. If you look in the window, 
you can see a severed arm. Ouch. 


Trophies:
---------
Submitted by:Varun Pandey

If you complete any of the races at the Hyman Memorial Stadium, you will get 
a trophy according to what race you completed. They appear on top of your 
television at the Vercetti Estate. There is also a trophy for doing the 
shooting range missions at the Downtown Ammunation
 

Guy With Cement Shoes In The Middle Of The Ocean:
-------------------------------------------------
Submitted by:Varun Pandey

Get a boat and from the Leaf Links Golf Course, head towards the second 
island. Now you should see a couple of big rocks under the water. You should 
see a guy with cement shoes just in the bottom of the ocean. If you still 
can't find him, get a boat and then head to Diaz's mansion. Now facing the 
mansion (you should be facing North according to the radar), turn right and 
keep going straight and you should see him. 


Hint:
-----
Submitted by: MadMahi(S.Mahesh)

when on a mission, if you want to kill the enemy driving in any vehicle 
(indicated with a marker in the map) just type bigbang. boom, the mission 
is completed.
Note: If you are inside any vehicle, get down from the vehicle and move 
to a distance and type bigbang. 


Money Cheat:
------------
Submitted by: Sanju

First buy any property that has garage. Then get A police car. 
Drive the car to your garage. Start the vigilante mission. 
Get out of the car. You will be give 60 seconds to return to a 
police vehicle. Get out of the garage. When the garage door closes 
type the cheat "BIGBANG". All nearby vehicles including the criminals 
vehicle will blast. And the vehicle you stored in the garage will be 
auto repaired. Then you will get a reward of 50 bucks. Then again 
enter the car that you stored in the garage. Again get out of the car. 
Again get out of the garage. Type in "BIGBANG". Again the threat will 
be eliminated. You could do this as many times as you like.


Hints - Get Past Airport Metal Detectors:
-----------------------------------------
Submitted by: Varun Pandey

To do this, first get a car and bring it to the Escobar International 
Airport. Now, park the car where the hood is facing the entrance to the 
airport. Now, run around to the back end of the car and jump on and then walk 
up to onto the hood. Now, jump from there over the metal detector and you are 
in with all of your weapons. Now, you can cause havoc with any weapon you 
please inside the airport. 


Helicopter With Wheels:
-----------------------
If you put a helicopter in the Pay N Spray, it will come out with wheels. 


Quick Cash:
-----------
To get some quick cash, go get a gun with auto targeting. I suggest getting a 
Tec9, Uzi, Ingram Mac 10, or MP5 for this part since you can run with those 
weapons. Now that you have it, go to North Point Mall. When you get there, go 
to the Tool Shop. Once there, rob it. Then when you have your wanted level, 
run to The Gash and change costumes. Then, rob The Gash and run to the tool 
shop and change clothes. Now, just repeat the process and the money will rack 
up. 


Faster Reload:
--------------
To get faster reload abilities, complete the shooting course at the Downtown 
Ammunation with a score of 45 or higher. 


Garage Trick:
-------------
This trick lets you put more garages than the designated amount. All you have 
to do is drive a car halfway in to where the door won't close. Now all you 
have to do is drive as many vehicles as you want in until it is packed. This 
will cause the garage to eat your cars sometimes so use at own risk. 


Free Pay N Spray:
-----------------
To do this, just put in the Health cheat before going inside the Pay N Spray 
and it will spray it for free. 


Coppers Can't Get Me Now:
-------------------------
If you are in a Coach, the cops cannot arrest you. They will simply make you 
lose control of the Coach but you will not get arrested. To gain control 
again, just get out of the Coach and get back in.

This is a really good way to make a quick $1,000. As it turns out, parking is 
ridiculously expensive in Vice City. On a North and South running street in 
Downtown on the second island (south of the Hyman Condo), there is a street 
covered in parking meters (it may be a curved street, I am not sure). If you 
run into them (or maybe use a tool like the hammer or baseball bat), you 
knock about $2-400 out of them. The only problem is if you hit them too fast, 
you will wrap your car around them and they'll get stuck in the engine. 
Explosions are usually imminent. I don't think that this willful destruction 
of private property even generates a wanted level so you're basically just 
able to get decent cash with minimal effort. 


No More Wanted Level:
---------------------
To automatically have no more wanted level, just save your game. Now, load it 
again and no more wanted level.

To tweak your vehicle use the file handling.cfg in the game folder.
Make sure you backup it first.You can change the weight, acceleration, 
top speed, centre of gravity & many other parameters of your vehicle.
Make sure you stay in limit of the parameters.

In Checkpoint Charlie it is very difficult to complete the mission using 
the speedboat.To make it easy all you have to do is to park an Infernus 
or Cheetah in the dock near the speedboat.As soon as the countdown beguns 
step into the car & type SEAWAYS.Now you can drive the car on water and 
complete the mission.

HOW TO FIND THE BIG PHALLUS IN VICE CITY
----------------------------------------
Here's one of the coolest Easter eggs for GTA: Vice City. 

Fly toward the "V.C. Hotel" or is it "D.C. Hotel" or 
something from the direction of the river behind the "Malibu", 
or just stand a little behind the "Malibu" club as the sun sets 
and you should see it, it will appear as the lights on the building 
are switched on in the shape of a phallus with two balls on either 
side, you can watch it for a minute or so more after it has formed 
to watch it "spout" semen (as the rest of the lights go on) as the 
Rockstar owner said in one PCF magazine (which is what started me 
on my hunt to find it, as he said it was his favourite part of the 
game, but I only found it while fooling around in the game yesterday 
with a completion meter of 75%).

Once found, you'll be able to see it almost every time it's there and 
you'll ask yourself why the heck you didn't see it in the first place! 

--------------------------------
A PART OF GTA3 IN GTA VICE CITY
--------------------------------
Another cool easter egg, you can find part of the city of "GTA3" 
depending on how well you know it (if you remember those stupid 
movie ads they had up in GTA3 like "Chuck Swartz is "Half Cocked""), 
go to the movie studio and look around at the sets near where you find 
one of the only hummers in GTA:VC (others at military base and Phil's 
place), there you'll find a set resembling one of GTA3's streets in 
Staunton Island I think, near the movie cinema, complete with a "Bolt 
Burgers" outlet.

------------------------
OTHER COOL EASTER EGGS
------------------------
Also, there are several pools on the island where Diaz's mansion used to 
be, but which becomes yours eventually in the middle of the game (denoted 
on the map by a giant "V" or "D" depending on where you are in the game)
where you can see a pool shaped like a woman's "bikini top and bottom" 
from the neck down (and observe where the diving board is placed ), one 
shaped like the Rockstar logo in which you can find a flame thrower, two 
with a beach ball inside them which you can use to test the "power" or your 
various guns and which blows up and fragments in an explosion and one which 
has a turtle picture drawn at the bottom of it. 
There are other interesting ones as well, but these are my fav.

The guy in the "Ammunation" store who sells you the guns also is wearing a 
jacket which has the Rockstar logo in the top corner, check it out with a 
sniper rifle for easy viewing (esp. on higher resolutions).

I'll just add that the little signs at the airport(which look like small 
read and yellow prism shaped ramps on the ground) can be used to do several 
good flips in a car, esp. if you're in a fast car like a Hotring racer 2 
(the one with chrome bumpers) and if you come all the way from the end of 
the opposite wall.

GTA Vice City Tips:

Submitted by: Shakespeare.
exclusivezia@yahoo.com
http://kofdangerous.simgames.net


Helicopters On Water:
---------------------
If you do the cars hover on water cheat, you can have your heli land in the 
water. 


More Money:
-----------
If you enter a taxi, you will automatically get money. 


Secret With Taxi:
-----------------
When doing a taxi mission (not for Kaufman Cabs), if you drop someone off 
right when the timer is at 0:00, the timer turns off and you can take as long 
as you want to drop people off at their destinations. You can do as many 
missions as you want. It's an easy way to make a lot of money if you have the 
time and patience to do it. 


Pogo The Monkey And Degenatron Arcades:
---------------------------------------
In the pizza joints and inside Kaufman Cabs, you can find these arcades but 
they are not playable. 


Australian American War:
------------------------
On the Vrock radio station, you will hear an Ammunation commercial that talks 
about the Australian-American War. If you remember correctly from Grand Theft 
Auto 3, there was a caller on Chatterbox that talks about fighting in the 
Australian-American War. 


Wow, What A Reward:
-------------------
After you complete all of the movie studio missions, a huge poster will 
appear at the Vercetti Estate of a nude Candy Suxxx and various pictures of 
her and the guy from "Martha's Mug Shot" will appear on your desk. 


Army Women:
-----------
To do this, put in the Ladies Man and Women Have Weapons cheats. Now, just 
steal a coach and let them on. Now, when you get off, you will have an army 
of women following you around. Quite funny. 


Supercop:
---------
The supercop is a cop that can bust you in just about any place! You could 
be going as fast as you can on say a PCJ-600, with no cop in sight (with a 
wanted level of course)m and you will suddenly get knocked off and busted. 
Or you can get a wanted level of some sort, 3 or more, and get in a Helicopter 
and rise as high as you can, and begin slowly moving forward to stay up 
there, but suddenly the door flies open and you come dropping out with a 
cop standing right next to you, gun down right at you and your Helicopter 
lying on top of you, busted. There is no way to kill him at all. The supercop 
also has super human speed. He runs faster than the PCJ-600 at top speed. 
The supercop is a menace to criminals worldwide! We must find a way to stop 
him!

ramps, and when in the air, press the 'wheelie' key until the bike is vertical, 
then press the 'stoppie' key to bring the front wheel down. do this as many times 
as possible while you are in the air, because every time the bike 'stands' vertical, 
it is recorded as a flip, and the more flips you have in a trick, the better the 
trick is and the more cash you get for it. Try this on any steep ramps.

2.Also, Try ramping on the 'ramp'-signs, but come in at an angle, and push the 
'wheelie' button. This makes for a really awesome jump rotation. I've gotten over 
2000 degrees.

when you stop your car near a girl that will bring your health to 125, and she stops 
at you're car, drive up the road a little bit. but to far to the point where you can't 
see her. now, once she starts going towards your car, get out of the car. now you've 
got a girl on you're side. but once you get in a car again, she will not climb in, but 
rather just wait. then, once you drive away, she will chase you're car. it's a pretty 
cool cheat. i use it all the time.

In the game many times you don't know where to go for the next mission. 
So, easy way is to caught by police by increasing wanted level. You can 
increase wanted level by killing people. The when you released from the 
police station a taxi is waiting out side, sit in it, it will take you to 
the next missions' destination.

now in data(line 37 in handling.cfg)
it is (N) TransmissionData.fMaxVelocity [5.0 to 150.0]
so in chart go to N(search in line 81) and in police ( line 106)edit value to say 1 the line 
(106) will look like this
POLICE 1600.0 2.1 5.0 1.6 0.0 0.0 0.15 75 1.05 0.78 0.52 5 1.0 28.0 4 P 11.1 0.53 0 35.0 2.

simillarly you can edit weapon.dat and change damage(G) to zero so that you wont die due 
to any gun


Hint:
-----
you can still kill others with a gun with zero damage just shoot their head or shoulder 
and they cant kill you!
but still keep a gun with some damage you need to shoot vehicles

1.How to get back on land.
When you are on a boat far from the land you can get to the land quickly by 
doing this trick. First of all be full health and armor. (Use cheats if you 
want.) You must be standing in the boat and not driving it. Now just type 
BIGBANG. The boat will burn and you will be standing on it .In about 10 
seconds you will find yourself in the nearest land area. Check this out.
Just mail me if you need more guidance.

2.How to find other thieves in VICE CITY
The most thief prone area is around north point mall. Between north point 
mall and pay n spray if you park a good car in the night you will soon find 
many people fighting for the car. To see this the best place there is a 
parabolic curve in this area towards the sea. Look in the game map in the 
main menu to find it. Now get a good car like Cheetah or Phoenix and get 
there in the night. Park it anywhere on the roadside. Just move some 50 
metres and you will see some guy in red or black shirt taking your car. 
If you want you can get back your car by throwing him out. After you get 
your car and get the non-driver side towards the thief he will enter the 
car and you will be forced to get out. If you accelerate before he completely 
gets in, you can travel with him. Some times he may do the driving and push 
you to the back seat. Check This Out. Just mail me if you need more help. 


How to Do a Upside Down Stunt:

and high jump. After you get to a corner and accelerate towards the high 
hump like structure start doing Wheelie using num 6 button. When you are 
in the sky press the wheelie button continuosly. You will surely do an 
upside down stunt. But very few times the reward will be given for it.

2.The invisible wall in the sea

Just go tho the horizon using a boat and far from Vice City. After some 
time you will find yourself being hit by something whuich rotates your 
boat by 180 degrees. If you again turn and go you will again be hit.

3.How to kill people in a large way

First of all burn a vehicle using a cheat or by firing. Soon people will 
gater around the burned vehicle. Now again type BIGBANG and many will die 
and much more will come near. By doing this you can kill a large number

Vehicle Repair
Tired of looking for payýn spray? Well now you don't have to look for it. 
Buy a house with a garage and if your car is damaged you can put it in the
garage and make the garage close. Then open it up and walla, your car is 
NOT damaged or broken. Also works on motorcycles. (does not work with the 
Rhino The Tank) And what i like most about it you can blow the car into 
pieces in your garage and open it up again and it's like new! (This is 
the best part) It's FREE! 

2] Tip For 'Waste the Wife' Mission
Here's just a little tip if you're having problems with the 'waste the 
wife' mission (i.e your car blows up before hers does) Answer the phone, 
listen to the call and get into the position either in a car or on a 
motorbike (motorbikes are easier) Watch the wife get in the car and 
drive off- chase her. She'll stop at some traffic lights, get close and 
jump off the bike (or out of the car) and quickly type in 'bigbang' her 
car and any other vehicle close by with explode. Instant mission success. 
Note: if you're in a car or on a bike when you type in the bigbang cheat 
then your car/bike will explode too, so it's best to get up close (without 
hitting her car otherwise she'll panic and flee) then jump out before 
typing the cheat. You'll still complete the mission, but you'll get wasted 
at the same time.) 

3]Check out at the check in
For this mission, you need to go to the airport, kill some guy, and drive 
through a gauntlet of cops, cars, and machine guns. It is usually impossible,
but there are a few alternatives. You can take the chopper from your mansion 
to the airport, fly to the airport, and then fly to the Amu-Nation. 
The other way is to run. Once you get the briefcase, go out of the airport 
and turn right on the road. Take the next left. After the turn, get on the 
next road and jump the rail. From there you are clear to run behind the 
junkyard and Phills place and come out from behind the Pizza place.

4]Secret Room
Go to the rooftop of the VCN building (on the second island) and walk to 
the closest wall facing the helipad (head West). There are a lot of windows
on the wall but one leads to a secret room. It is the easiest one to reach 
but if you have trouble finding it look out for any little white dots on 
the wall, just jump through it and you appear in a small room with a 
chocolate Easter egg saying happy Easter.

Put the flying car cheat in(comeflywithme)THIS CHEAT CAN GET YOU STUCK AT 99%! 
Best to use it after you beat the game.Now get a tank(panzer).Turn the turret 
180 degres. FIRE FIRE FIRE. while hitting th gas DO NOT STOP SHOOTING OR YOU 
WILL FALL! Fly higher than the airoplanes do(not the little red one).go over 
the stadium and go streight down( it took me a while to get there because 
I kept on missing) If you have 2 stars this is eazier because you can try 
to land right beside the "floating" cop car.I am not shure what it is I 
think it is the hot ring track suspended in the air with no senery.

When You are on a Mission "Alloy Wheels on Metal" in which TOmmy has to 
race with Harley Davidson Bike, dont worry for that. Just ride your bike 
as usual, you will see that all your opponents will fall down after 
sometime (Poor Guys) and you will win the race very easily(drive carefully 
and don't fall off, no need to drive very fast). I played this race for 16

It was a fun for me to clear it 100%.I wish that all can do this.
Here is a hint for all to get some quick cash. 
To get some quick cash, go get a gun with auto targeting. I suggest getting a 
Tec9, Uzi, Ingram Mac 10, or MP5 for this part since you can run with those 
weapons. Now that you have it, go to North Point Mall. When you get there, go 
to the Tool Shop. Once there, rob it. Then when you have your wanted level, 
run to The Gash and change costumes. Then, rob The Gash and run to the tool 
shop and change clothes. Now, just repeat the process and the money will rise.

the safe with a colt python (handgun that kills people in one shot) then when 
it tells you to kill lance just sprint up to him and chase while ignoring 
everyone else. continue chasing lance up the stairs and kill everyone in your 
way(Just before you go on the roof you may want to use cheats like restore 
health and restore armor). When you get to the roof run towards the helicopter 
pad and pick off everyone slowly while hiding behind the wall near the

wide stairs in the huge hall. Then a cutscene with sonny forelli will appear 
and as soon as that is over run away from him and run back upto the rooftop 
where you killed lance, then get out your rocket launcher (use cheat if necessary, 
and remember to refresh your health and armor). With your rocket launcher stand 
on the edge of the rooftop on the tiles until you can see the !
three limosines that spawn enemies then blow those three up to make life easier. 
Then jump all the way down to driveway but make sure you re well away from the 
front stairs when you make your jump. When you hit the ground remember to kill 
anyone attacking you (refresh your health and armor with cheats if necessary). 
Then approach the from the large stairs( you should be outside now). Then fire 
at Sonny like there's now tommorrow with rockets it took me five rockets for 
me to kill him.

GTA: Vice City Easter Eggs:
---------------------------
Grow\Shrink Moon - At night, shoot the full moon with a sniper rifle. The moon will grow and
shrink each time you shoot it.


A real virtual Easter Egg:
--------------------------
Aim for the Helipad on top of the Vice City-News Station (on the second Island). Sometimes there
is the VCN Mavrick on the Helipad. The building on the right has a hallow wall so you can go 
through it. The hallow part is a unrealistic looking window on the left of it. Run from one 
side of the heliport to the other and then jump into the hallow window. There you will see the
Easter Egg with a sign on it that says 


Happy Easter:
-------------
GTA: Vice City Secrets
Change vehicle stats
In the GTA-Vice City Directory, there should be a subdirectory called data. In this 
folder you'll find a file called "Handling.cfg". Change the File name to "Handling.txt" 
and open it. Here you can change the weight of the car, it's crash damage multiplier, 
speed, Acceleration and others. The file itself gives good pointers towards which 
values should be changed, and you should backup any files you intend to edit.


GTA: Vice City Glitches:
------------------------
Get Hookers in the Australian Version
Australian Hookers will simply not get in your car, however if you drive next to a 
hooker and use the ''pedestrians get in car'' cheat 'HOPINGIRL' the hooker /will/ 
get into the car, and when you go to a secluded place the car starts rocking and 
increases your health to up to 25 HP more. 


Quick Reload:
-------------
When you are using a weapon and finish off a clip, quickly scroll the mouse wheel up, 
then quickly back down to the weapon you were using. The weapon should already be 
reloaded. This makes it easier when in a gang battle.
Put two Vehicles in Your Garage
One of the Two vehicles MUST be a Motorcycle. Get a Motorcycle and park it half way 
into the entrance (preferably of to the side). Get another Motorcycle or a car nearby 
and drive it into the garage. Hop on the Motorcycle thats parked halfway and drive 
that in too. 


Now you have 2 Vehicles in your garage!:
----------------------------------------
All Buildings and Terrain Disappear- Find Packages with ease!
Take a bike (PCJ works well) and ride it as fast as you can into the Pole Position 
Strip Club entrance way, but before you get there hop off the bike and let it slide 
all the way to the end. Then enter the Pole Position and you should be standing on 
or next to your bike. If it is far enough down the hall you can get on it without 
having to exit the building. Once on the bike and having exited the building you can 
go anywhere in the game without the distracting buildings and terrain showing up; 
they are all invisible.


Change your dressings according to your own wish:
-------------------------------------------------

Cheat:

Submitted by: Anirban Basak

ATTENTION: YOULL KNOW WAY TO COMPLETE 100% OF VICE CITY AND UNLOCK EVERYTHING HERE

Dont Forget to check off Read-only attribute after restoring backed up savegames!!
If not in game your current game will never be saved.


To complete 100% download a walkthrough and follow it.
Download location of hidden package, rampage, stunt map and follow them.

The Pizza Mission is the most irritating mission in VC.
Play it as first as possible at the north of left isle.
Slow down time 1 level using cheat(BOOOOOORING).
It ends with the last delivery of level 10.

Always throw pizza passing in front of the customer.(You can slow down slightly)
Else they wont see it and wont grab it.
It will waste 1 pizza, take time aprox. 5s and whip on your patience.


Use shortcuts. They save time.

To do boatyard mission - checkpoint charlie

Believe me you wont be able to do it even with squalo II(the fastest boat!!)
You need to modify it.
Open .\data\handling.cfg

In the O coloumn of the row of squalo Engine accl is 3.0
Change it to 4.0
In the N coloumn of the row of squalo Max velocity is 190.0
Change it to 200.0

Load your game. Put 2 level slow down (BOOOOOORING) and play carefully.

There are two types of cheats in Vice City Game

One(1) which corrupt savegames and other(2) which does not.

Get the list of cheats from any source.
To find 1st type of cheat load a clean savegame enter the cheat and try to save.
If you get a message of warning the cheat is of 1st type(1). Else its 2nd type(2).

If a savegame is corrupted whenever you'll try to save it it will always warn you
about it.

Use of 1st type cheats corrupts game and prevents from getting 100% and also prevent 
unlocking of various things.

But if you use 2nd type cheats your game will not be corrupted and you may get 100%.
If you have completed everything YOU WILL GET 100% though you use 2nd type cheats.
If you dont get dont blame 2nd type cheat as IT IS NOT THE REASON.
You must have skipped something. Download any walkthrough and check it.

I HAVE USED THESE 2ND TYPE CHEATS
(ASPIRINE,PRECIOUSPROTECTION,LEAVEMEALONE,YOUWONTTAKEMEALIVE,THUGSTOOLS,
PROFESSIONALTOOLS,NUTTERTOOLS,PANZER,BIGBANG,ALOVELYDAY,ONSPEED,BOOOOOORING)
THROUGHOUT THE GAME(FROM BEGINNING TILL THE END, EVERYTIME NEEDED) AND IVE RECEIVED NO 
WARNNING AND IVE COMPLETED 100% WITH ALL THE FEATURES UNLOCKED
(WHICH I KNOW ALL OF THE GAME ACCORDING TO THE NET)

Trust me and dont panic to use cheats because they save a lot of time and a bigger lot
of energy. (Ive completed Vice City 100% with a walkthrough and cheat in just 10 days 
and it is true!!)

Use the cheat "Comeflywithme" to fly your car in air. Now fly and reach near the airport,

there is no plane taking its flight then either wait for one to fly or make your balance in 
flying a car to reach on the top on any plane which is currently flying in the sky (you need 
a bit practise to do it). After you have landed on the top of the plane, get out of your car, 
go near the head of the plane and press Enter key---you will find yourself in the plane the 
very next moment. Now use "professionaltools" cheat to get rolling machine gun and start 
firing here and there. As soon as you fired for some time you will find "Plane Hijacked" 
written on your screen and your account balance will be increased automatically as you have 
been paid all the money by the passengers of the plane. The only problem is that you cannot 
fly the plane, so now jump from plane to die. after you get healed from hospital , you will

Hi friends, Here is trick by which you can complete vice city with using cheat codes. If you use 
cheats then you can only complete 99% of the game. First go to goggle then search for vice city 
trainers. Then download two trainers one of them should be GTA Vice ultimate Trainer the second 
could be any one with has a feature of deactivate all cheat codes.
To make work the first trainer you will have to put the trainer in vice city folder. Then go to 
MY DOCUMENTS / GTA vice City User Files THEN COPY THE FILE keys to vice city folder. Then the 
trainer will work. Now start vice city then start a new game then press alt + tab to get out then 
start the first trainer and use any cheat you want just by pressing one button!! Then when you 
have to save your game then close the first trainer and open the second one. Then deactivate all 
the cheats and then no warning will appear at the screen. And now you can save the game without 
any risk. And rest of the things I know are in the cheat book. If you have any problem than mail 
me at nilesh3105@gmail.com and please put the subject gta: vice city/vc 
The same trick can also be done in Grand Theft Auto - San Andreas.

Demolition Man:
---------------
Submitted by: Amrit
Email : amritsingh100@gmail.com

$1000
Difficulty: Hard

A new office block that's being build stands in the way of Avery's plans for that place, so 
you'll have to demolish the building while Avery is out of town. You will get a radio controlled 
helicopter to do this, plus four bombs and a seven minute time-limit. I've heard a lot of people 
complaining this mission was too hard, so I will try to give some advices in how it can be done
easier. And believe me: this mission is not impossible. I managed to beat this mission while 
still having 2:35 minutes on the counter, and it can probably be done even faster. Anyway, here 
are the tips:

First, and most important of all: you must be able to control helicopters very well. Be sure you 
have your controls configured a way you're comfortable with, and then practise a lot with helicopters, 
try to do stunts and stuff. The best training can be found at the airport: there's a Topfun van 
parked there. If you get in, you can practise with the RC helicopter in a checkpoint race. Important 
keys when flying a helicopter in Vice City are the 'look left' and 'look right' keys, which allow 
you to turn the helicopter without going forwards or backwards.

Once you have mastered the heli's controls, start the mission. After the mission briefing, get in 
the Topfun van, but do not pick up any bombs yet. First go to the construction place to find out 
what it looks like, where all bombs must be placed and where the stairs are (of course you can 
also do this before the mission starts). Workers will start to attack you when they see you, but 
if you fly very low they will get killed by the heli's blades. Kill everyone at the construction 
place before you do anything else. You must be able to fly inside the building without hitting 
any walls or ceilings. If you cannot do this, then I can almost assure you that you have not enough 
flying skills to complete this mission, or at least it will be very hard.

Notice the way the stairs go and the way the bombs must be placed: the first bomb spot is at 
the West side of the building, the second at the East side of the building, the third West again,
and the fourth East again. If you remember this you can get to the bomb spots quicker then when 
you have to look at your radar everytime.

Once all the workers and guards at the construction side are dead, fly back to pick up your 
first bomb. Be sure to have the RC heli facing towards the construction side when picking up 
the first bomb, so you won't have to turn the first time (ok, you'll probably only win two 
seconds with this, but every second is important if you can't seem to pass this mission). 
Now pick it up, and fly to the construction side as fast as possible. Always keep your 'lean 
forward' key pressed. Next to that you should keep correcting your height by pressing your 
'forward/up' and 'backward/down' keys. This will also increase your speed.

Plant the bomb by pressing your 'fire' button while flying above the bomb spots. Then go 
back as fast as you can to pick up another bomb, and keep repeating this until you've 
placed all four bombs. Now here's something important: always start by placing the first 
bomb on the lowest floor (on the ground), the second one on the first floor of the building, 
the third one of the second floor and the fourth one at the third floor. In other words: 
place the bombs from low to high. This is important, because after the fourth bomb is placed 
you don't have to go back. If you place the highest bomb last, you won't have to go all the 
way down again, and this will save a lot of time compared to when you place the last bomb 
somewhere else.

Once all four bombs are placed the building will explode, and your mission will be completed.

Messing with the man:
----------------------
Submitted by: Amrit

$2000
Difficulty: Medium

You will have to show the city how pissed you are. Don't ask why, just do it. You'll have 
to create a lot of chaos, so the chaos-meter will fill up. You must fill the whole bar 
within two minutes in order to complete the mission.

This is not that hard. Just get some weapons with ammo before you start the mission. 
Molotov Cocktails, a Colt (together with about 200 bullets) and a Rocket Launcher with 
some rockets will do. Now create some havoc already before you start the mission. A two-star 
wanted level will do. Then start with the mission. After the mission briefing, run 
immediately to the stairs that lead to the roof of the building opposite the Greasy Chopper. 
Get up, and walk to the end of the roof.


Now keep messing with your weapons until you have a three-star wanted level. Best way to 
do this is by shooting on police cars with your Colt. Now wait until a helicopter comes in. 
The only thing you have to do now is just keep shooting at the helicopter with your Colt. 
Don't destroy it with your Rocket Launcher, since it will explode then, and the bar will 
only fill up a little bit. If you keep shooting with your Colt however, you'll be able to 
fill up the whole bar. Kill any SWAT-members that might come out of the helicopter.

I've also heard about a trick that you can keep shooting on a car, even after it has 
exploded, but this did not work for me, so it probably only works in the Playstation 2 
version of the game. An overall tip: play this mission in the afternoon (ingame), so 
you can be sure there will be enough vehicles to destroy. I once played it at night, and 
I couldn't get a third wanted-star, because there were no cars at all on the streets, 
not even police cars.

Once you've filled the bar you've completed the mission. Your wanted-star level remains 
though. No problem: just save your game at the Skumole Shack savepoint (it's located on 
the same roof where you are), or buy it first if you didn't own it already (it will only 
cost you $1000). Just save your game, then reload, and your wanted-stars are gone. [up]

Playing the last mission:

Submitted by: Aryan

Many people say that they are not able to play the last mission "keep your friends close", 
even if they have bought all the properties all around the map. I'd like to inform them 
that to play the last mission, they have to buy all the properties, do all the missions and 
then check the list of vehicles near the sunshine autos. once they have exported all the cars 
in each of the lists, they will be able to play the mission.

this is a way from witch you can spawn unlimited ammu-nation.
heres the idea!
you can get unlimited ammo for the guns.just go to the source folder of the game and go to 
DATA and open the weapons.dat file in note pad.
before doing,make a backup copy of weapons.dat file.
there are specific line numbers given to each type of data in front of the name of the 
gun .fro eg:c-ammunation etc
just change the value of given data of a specific gun.
like for python :ammunation-c
6
just the value of 6 to 999
your gun will get the ammunation of 999 rounds pre clip!

this cheat is found specificly by me and if you get into any kind of problem
just visit to my site davidgodfren@rediffmail.com and give me chance to sort out your 
problems.


Easy money:
-----------
Occasionally as you wander around the city, you will encounter a cop fighting with a gang
member (especially in Northpoint Mall). If you step in and hit the gang member, you will 
receive a $50 Good Citizen's Bonus when the gang member dies. Once the guy is on the 
ground, you can continue to kick him and receive the bonus two or three more times (until
the body disappears). This is an easy way to get some quick cash, and do some fighting 
in the process.


Death Row mission:
------------------
Go to the Malibu Club in a really fast car, such as an Inferno. Get the mission brief.
Drive as fast as you can towards the junkyard. When around the corner from enable the 
"Rhino" code to spawn a tank. Drive towards the guards, blasting them with the tank's 
cannon. Once inside the junkyard, kill as many men as you can by running them over with 
the tank. Grab Lance and make your way back toward the tank. Then, take him to the 
hospital to complete the mission.
